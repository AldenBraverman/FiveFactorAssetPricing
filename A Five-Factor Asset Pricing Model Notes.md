There is evidence that **average stock returns are related to the book-to-market equity ratio, *B/M***

There is evidence that **profitability and investment add to the description of average returns provided by *B/M***

**Dividend discount model** can be used to explain why these variables are related to average returns

The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of a company's stock based on the present value of its future dividend payments. The fundamental idea is that a stock is worth the sum of all future dividends, discounted back to their present value.

This formula is known as the Gordon Growth Model or the Constant Growth Dividend Discount Model. It assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate indefinitely.

For companies with varying dividend growth rates, more complex versions of the DDM, such as the Multi-Stage Dividend Discount Model, can be used to account for changes in growth rates over time.

Basic Formula:
$P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g}$
where:
- $P_0$ = Current stock price
- $D_1$ = Dividend expected next year
- $r$ = Required rate of return (discount rate)
- $g$ = Growth rate of dividends

We need to define assumptions for required rate of return and dividend growth rate
- Required Rate of Return
	- **Historical Market Returns**: Historically, the average annual return for the S&P 500 has been around 7-10% over the long term, including dividends. A 7% rate of return is in line with historical equity returns, making it a reasonable benchmark.
	- **Risk-Free Rate**: The required rate of return often includes the risk-free rate (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury yield) plus a risk premium. As of recent data, the 10-year Treasury yield is around 4-5%. Adding a risk premium of 2-3% for equity investments yields a total required return of approximately 7%.
	- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: The CAPM can be used to estimate the required rate of return based on the risk-free rate, the stock's beta, and the expected market return. For example
		- $Required Rate Of Return = Risk Free Rate + β * (Market Return - Risk Free Rate)$
		- If the risk-free rate is 4%, the market return rate is 8%, and the stock's beta is 1.0, the required rate of return would be 8% (4% + 1.0 * (8% - 4%))
		- A stock's beta (β) is a measure of its volatility or risk compared to the overall market. In finance, beta is used to understand how much a stock's price is expected to move relative to movements in a market index, such as the S&P 500
			- **Beta** is a measure of a stock's sensitivity to market movements. It indicates how much the stock's price is likely to change in response to a change in the market index.
			- A beta of 1 means the stock's price is expected to move with the market. If the market goes up by 1%, the stock is also expected to go up by 1%, and vice versa.
			- A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility compared to the market. For example, a beta of 1.5 means the stock is expected to move 50% more than the market. If the market goes up by 1%, the stock is expected to go up by 1.5%.
			- A beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility compared to the market. For instance, a beta of 0.5 means the stock is expected to move 50% less than the market.
